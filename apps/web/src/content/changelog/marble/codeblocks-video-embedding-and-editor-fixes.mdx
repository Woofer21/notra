This week focused on expanding editor capabilities and fixing UI interaction issues. The release adds support for custom codeblocks and video embedding, along with improved error handling for clipboard operations and refinements to dropdown and popover behaviors in the editor.

## Highlights

### Custom codeblock support with clipboard error handling

A new codeblock component enables more flexible content formatting, paired with error handling for clipboard operations to gracefully manage permission issues and unavailable APIs.

### Video embedding extension

Authors can now embed video content directly into documents, adding another content type to the editor's capabilities.

### Fixed dropdown and popover interactions

Resolved issues preventing dropdowns from opening on click and fixed popover triggers in editor codeblocks, while also preventing unintended dropdown edits.
